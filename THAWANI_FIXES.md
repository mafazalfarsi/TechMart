# Thawani Pay Integration Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Checkout URL Format
**Problem**: The checkout URL was incorrectly formatted as:
```
https://uatcheckout.thawani.om/api/v1{session_id}
```

**Fix**: Updated to the correct format:
```
https://uatcheckout.thawani.om/pay/{session_id}
```

### 2. JSON Request Handling
**Problem**: The Django view was expecting form data but the frontend was sending JSON data.

**Fix**: Updated the view to handle both JSON and form data:
```python
# Handle both JSON and form data
import json
customer_data = {}

if request.headers.get('Content-Type') == 'application/json':
    try:
        customer_data = json.loads(request.body)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        customer_data = {}

customer_name = customer_data.get('customer_name') or request.POST.get('customer_name', 'Guest User')
customer_phone = customer_data.get('customer_phone') or request.POST.get('customer_phone', '')
customer_email = customer_data.get('customer_email') or request.POST.get('customer_email', '')
delivery_address = customer_data.get('delivery_address') or request.POST.get('delivery_address', '')
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
**Added**: Better debugging information in the view:
```python
print(f"Request body: {request.body}")
print(f"Content-Type: {request.headers.get('Content-Type', 'Not set')}")
```

## Verification Tests

### 1. Direct API Test
Created `test_thawani_api.py` to verify the Thawani API is working correctly:
- ✅ API credentials are valid
- ✅ Endpoint is correct
- ✅ Payload structure is correct
- ✅ Response format is as expected

### 2. Django Integration Test
Created `test_django_payload.py` to verify the Django integration:
- ✅ Django server is running
- ✅ URL routing is working
- ✅ View is processing requests correctly
- ✅ JSON responses are being returned properly

## Current Status

The Thawani Pay integration is now working correctly. The 404 error was caused by the incorrect checkout URL format, which has been fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Test with actual cart items**: Add items to your cart and test the payment flow
2. **Verify success/cancel URLs**: Make sure the success and cancel URLs are working correctly
3. **Test webhook integration**: Verify that payment status updates are being received correctly
